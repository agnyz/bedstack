# Governance Model

To understand the scope of this document, please read:

* [*What is governance?* by Adobe](https://github.com/adobe/open-development-template/blob/master/Governance.md#meritocracy)

## Who we are

We are a group of open-source developers who develop, use, promote the Elysia RealWorld example app, software around it, and other related activities for our mutual benefit.

## Core Philosophy

* **Lower barrier to entry**

    Everyone is welcome to contribute, regardless of their background, experience, or identity. We value all contributions, and we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Everyone gets a voice, and everyone is listened to. 

* **Seeking consensus**

    We seek consensus among contributors, and we are open to new ideas and approaches. When consensus cannot be reached after giving the stage to all parties, we will use a majority-wins voting process. We will strive to resolve conflicts in a constructive manner.

* **Meritocracy**

    We value contributions based on their technical merit, and we welcome new contributors based on their demonstrated ability to contribute. Valuable contributers will be granted access to private channels and will be able to participate in the decision-making process.
  
* **Transparency**
  
    While the decision-making process is not always public, the results of the decision making process must be public. Decisions will be made after thoughtful consideration of the community's input through [Discord](https://discord.gg/PH4rBdTU) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/agnyz/the-bed-stack/discussions).

* **Automation**

    We rely on automation to make our processes more efficient and to reduce the burden on contributors. We will automate as much as possible, and we will strive to make our automation tools accessible to all contributors. The goal is to abstract away the mundane tasks and let contributors focus on the fun stuff.
